## Dev environment
Maybe. I don't know how much is needed to actually build and set stuff up. I think that this might be it? Otherwise, here are the instructions to set it up locally.

You will need node installed.

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 10
sudo npm install -g gulp
```
Navigate to the project folder, the following command will have you answer some questions
```
sudo npm install semantic-ui --save
cd semantic
gulp build
```
